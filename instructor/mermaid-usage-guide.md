# Using Mermaid Diagrams in Microsoft Fabric Course

This guide explains how to use the Mermaid diagrams provided in this course with both mermaidchart.com and VS Code.

## Viewing Diagrams in VS Code

1. The VS Code Markdown Mermaid extension (`bierner.markdown-mermaid`) is already installed in your environment.
2. Open any of the diagram files in VS Code:
   - `mermaid-diagrams.md` - Contains all diagrams for each course segment
   - `simple-iot-diagram.md` - Contains simplified IoT diagrams
3. Use VS Code's built-in Markdown preview (Ctrl+Shift+V or âŒ˜+Shift+V on Mac) to see the rendered diagrams.

## Using Diagrams with mermaidchart.com

If you encounter errors when pasting diagrams into mermaidchart.com, follow these steps:

1. Use the simplest version of the diagram (the "Text-only Version" in `simple-iot-diagram.md`).
2. When copying code to mermaidchart.com:
   - Remove all styling classes (classDef and class declarations)
   - Remove all styling attributes
   - Keep the basic graph structure with nodes and edges
