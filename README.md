# Microsoft Fabric Quick Start (Live Online Training)

## Introduction

This live online course was modeled on the M[icrosoft Certified: Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/fabric-analytics-engineer-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification) certification. That said, its content isn't particularly cert-aligned. Instead, the dual job role (data engineer and data analyst) focus was helpful in aggregating what I wanted to teach. -Tim
