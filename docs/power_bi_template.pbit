This is a placeholder for a Power BI template file (.pbit).

To create an actual Power BI template:

1. Follow the steps in the tutorial to create your Power BI report
2. Save your report as a .pbix file
3. In Power BI Desktop, go to File > Export > Save as Template
4. Save the template as "Retail Analytics Template.pbit"

The template will include:
- All your data model relationships
- All your DAX measures
- All your report pages and visuals
- All your formatting and layout

Users can then open this template and connect to their own Fabric workspace to create their own report based on your design.

Note: The actual .pbit file is a binary file and cannot be directly edited as text. This is just a placeholder with instructions.
